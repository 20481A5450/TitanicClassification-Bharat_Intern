## Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic problem in the field of data science and machine learning.

## Dataset

- **Dataset:** Titanic dataset
- **Source:** Provided dataset in a ZIP archive

## Data Exploration

We start by exploring the dataset to gain insights:

- Importing important libraries
- Importing the dataset
- Exploring the dataset's shape and basic statistics
- Visualizing survival counts with respect to various features

## Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values in the age column
- Encoding categorical variables like 'Sex' using LabelEncoder
- Dropping non-required columns

## Model Training

We train a logistic regression model using the 'Pclass' and 'Sex' features.

## Model Prediction

We make predictions using the trained model and evaluate its performance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/20481A5450/TitanicClassification-Bharat_Intern.git
cd TitanicClassification-Bharat_Intern
```

2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (specified in a requirements file).

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the project.
